All project's documentation is here.

# Building Documentation

A build process is automated by tox and Sphinx from reStructuredText sources.
To build the documentation run the next command:

```
$ tox -e html
```

And then just open built documentation `build/html/index.html` in your browser
(Of source, using your favourite tool, e.g. open or xdg-open!).
