OSS Architecture Overview
=========================

This document includes the following sections:

* :ref:`arch-layers`
* :ref:`arch-infra-components`
* :ref:`arch-lcm`

.. _arch-layers:

Architecture Layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Environment - OSS Tooling is going to run on top of VMs or bare-metal nodes
   that run MS ISO that contains everything that runs on host level
   pre-installed, this allows us to:

        #. Bootstrap OSS Tooling infrastructure without internet
        #. Have pretty simple & automated initial deployment procedure
        #. Reinstall host nodes with new ISO when they are released
                   (security updates)

#. Infrastructure - Goal of this level is to provide everything required to run
   containers on host system. It should provide at least docker, shared file
   system (Glusterfs) and HA.

#. Data Stores - Only services from this level, should deal with real data (be
   state full), those require more testing including scalability, performance
   and HA, DR.

#. Core Services - This is list of services required to implement Microservices
   approach. These services usually don't have direct ad-value for customer and
   are heavily used by microservices of higher levels.

#. Backend - This level basically implement all OSS Tooling functionality. Each
   service provides.

#. Frontend - Provides UI and Rest API to end users with granular access to
   different part of MS Tooling.

The described layers above are figured on the next picture:

.. _arch-infra-components:

Infrastructure Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Ansible

    Ansible in conjunction with the automation deployment playbooks is used for
    initial deployment of OSS Tools and comes as a part of OSS ISO.

#. Docker

    Docker is going to be used for all services used by all OSS Tools. Each
    service has own pre-built image which is stored into private
    docker-registry. Docker is shipped with OSS ISO and automatically
    configured during the deployment.

#. Docker Registry

    Docker Registry is used for all images of all services, configured in
    HA-mode across the deployment nodes.

#. Kubernetes

    Kubernetes is responsible for automating deployment, scaling and life cycle
    management operations of OSS services across cluster of pre-deployed hosts.

#. ElasticSearch

    ElasticSearch is used for storing searchable metrics and probes which are
    used by OSS Tools services, configured in the clustered mode during
    the deployment.

.. _arch-lcm:

Life Cycle Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Bootstrap (once)

  * Setup Site-to-Site (if possible)
  * Run OSS Tooling ISO on 3+ VMs or bare-metal servers
  * Copy latest releases of OSS Tooling docker images
  * Fix inventory of ansible and run it

* Host level upgrades (every 3 months)

  #. Copy ansible inventory file
  #. Backup Data Store level
  #. Nuke 1 server
  #. Install new ISO on available hardware
  #. Re-run ansible with old inventory file to restore system
  #. Wait for 30 minutes to make sure new version works (check logs, monitors)
  #. Go to 3 until old host exists


* Tooling upgrades (every week)

  * Copy new containers images
  * Re-run containers (rolling upgrade) with new versions
  * Containers should take care of data migration
  * Containers should take care of support of working old/new versions
